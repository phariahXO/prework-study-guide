# <Understanding the absolute basics of web developement>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was my curiosity on how the inner workings of how websites function.
- I built this project in order to garner a basic understanding of website building.
- The problem my specific website solves is holding some of the information I learned during my prework that I can refer to if I were to be stumped on some of the basics.(Which I will lol)
- This prework has taught me that I have a lot to learn in order to become remotely adept and confident in my ability to code.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
